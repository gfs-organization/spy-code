In the first years of the Great Platypus Wars, the Skamokawa Ducks of the Northern Forest Region intercepted a coded
message sent from their enemies in the south, the Temecula Beavers. The Ducks were stumped, and were unable to decipher
the simple code. But then their spies hidden deep in the Beaver ranks managed to overhear two messages before they were
sent.

First Message:

- What the spy heard: "The sly grey fox ran fast."
- What the Skamokawa Ducks intercepted: "Uid!rmx!fsdx!gny!s`o!g`ru/"

Second Message:

- What the spy heard: "One ring to rule them all."
- What the Skamokawa Ducks intercepted: "Nod!shof!un!stmd!uidl!`mm/"

Can you help the Skamokawa Ducks write a decoder algorithm so they can easily read any encoded message sent by the
Beavers?

Hints:

- Don't think too complicated. The Beavers are not that sophisticated.
- If you pass your decoded, plain text answer back into the same solution, you will get the original encoded String
  back.
